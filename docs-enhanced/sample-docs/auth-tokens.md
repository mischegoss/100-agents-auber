# Authentication Token Management

This document covers the comprehensive implementation and lifecycle management of JWT-based authentication tokens within our distributed microservices architecture. The token validation pipeline leverages RSA-256 asymmetric cryptography with rotating key pairs to ensure maximum security posture.

## Token Acquisition Protocol

The initial token acquisition follows OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE extensions. Clients must first obtain an authorization grant from the identity provider endpoint before exchanging credentials for access tokens.

```javascript
const tokenResponse = await fetch('/api/v2/auth/token', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
  },
  body: new URLSearchParams({
    grant_type: 'authorization_code',
    code: authorizationCode,
    client_id: clientId,
    code_verifier: codeVerifier,
    redirect_uri: redirectUri,
  }),
})

const { access_token, refresh_token, expires_in } = await tokenResponse.json()
```

## JWT Payload Structure

Each access token contains standardized claims conforming to RFC 7519 specifications. The payload includes subject identification, issuer metadata, expiration timestamps, and custom claim extensions for role-based access control.

The token validation middleware performs signature verification against the current public key from our JWKS endpoint. Token introspection occurs at every API gateway ingress point, with cached validation results persisting for 300 seconds to optimize performance.

## Refresh Token Rotation

Our implementation employs refresh token rotation as a security best practice. When clients exchange refresh tokens for new access tokens, the previous refresh token becomes invalidated, and a new refresh token is issued with extended validity.

```python
def rotate_refresh_token(current_refresh_token):
    # Validate current refresh token
    payload = validate_jwt(current_refresh_token, verify_expiration=True)

    # Generate new token pair
    new_access_token = generate_access_token(payload['sub'])
    new_refresh_token = generate_refresh_token(payload['sub'])

    # Invalidate old refresh token
    blacklist_token(current_refresh_token)

    return {
        'access_token': new_access_token,
        'refresh_token': new_refresh_token,
        'expires_in': 3600
    }
```

## Session Timeout Configuration

Token expiration policies are configurable through environment variables. Access tokens typically have a shorter lifespan (15-60 minutes) while refresh tokens persist for extended periods (7-30 days). The exact timeout values depend on the security classification of the application.

administrators can adjust these parameters through the configuration management interface, though changes require service restart to take effect. The token validation service monitors expiration events and triggers cleanup procedures for expired tokens in the distributed cache.

Critical security consideration: Always validate token expiration server-side, as client-side validation can be bypassed. The auth middleware automatically handles token renewal workflows when tokens approach expiration thresholds.
