# Credential Policy

## Policy Statement

Our organization is committed to a robust security posture through the strategic management of credentialing. This policy outlines the high-level principles governing the lifecycle of all user credentials within the enterprise ecosystem. Adherence to these guidelines is mandatory for ensuring synergistic alignment with our security objectives and compliance frameworks.

## Governance

Credential composition must exhibit sufficient complexity. Passphrases should be formulated to resist common dictionary attacks and brute-force methodologies. The system's enforcement mechanisms are calibrated to our risk tolerance profile. Periodic credential rotation is encouraged to proactively mitigate exposure from unforeseen data breaches. All credential modifications are subject to our standard change control paradigms.

## User Responsibilities

End-users are the primary custodians of their assigned credentials. It is incumbent upon them to safeguard this information and report any suspected compromise through the appropriate channels without delay. Sharing credentials is a violation of this policy and will be actioned accordingly by the governance team. Users must leverage the provided tools for self-service remediation whenever feasible.
