# Account Lockout Procedures

## Lockout Overview

Understanding the fundamentals of account security mechanisms.

The system will automatically lock an account after several consecutive failed access attempts. This is a primary security feature to prevent unauthorized access. When a lockout occurs, the user will be denied access to all integrated services until the account's state is reset.

## End-User Actions

What to do when your account becomes locked.

If your account is locked, you must wait for the automatic lockout period to expire. The duration of this period is set by the system administrator. Attempting to log in during the lockout period may extend the duration. If immediate access is required, you must contact an administrator for manual intervention.

## Administrator Resolution

Administrative procedures for resolving lockout situations.

Administrators can view the status of locked accounts from within the management console. To resolve a lockout, locate the user's account and use the administrative function to unlock it. Before unlocking, verify the user's identity according to internal security protocols. Further details on user identity verification are available in the security team's documentation.
