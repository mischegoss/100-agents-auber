# System Diagnostic Procedures

## General Information

This document outlines various approaches for investigating system irregularities and performance anomalies. The diagnostic framework provides multiple entry points for troubleshooting activities.

### Monitoring Infrastructure

The platform includes comprehensive telemetry collection mechanisms that aggregate metrics from distributed components. These metrics flow through the observability pipeline for analysis and alerting.

```javascript
const diagnostics = require('./lib/diagnostics');

// Basic health check implementation
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  const dbStatus = diagnostics.checkDatabase();
  const cacheStatus = diagnostics.checkCache();
  const queueStatus = diagnostics.checkMessageQueue();
  
  res.json({
    status: 'operational',
    services: {
      database: dbStatus,
      cache: cacheStatus,
      queue: queueStatus
    },
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});
```

### Log Analysis Techniques

Application logs contain structured information about system operations and error conditions. Log aggregation tools can filter and search across multiple service instances.

Common log patterns indicate specific types of issues. Database connection errors typically manifest as connection timeout messages in the application logs.

## Specific Scenarios

### Performance Degradation

When the system exhibits slower response times, several factors should be investigated. Database query performance often correlates with overall application responsiveness.

Memory pressure indicators include increased garbage collection frequency and heap utilization warnings. CPU utilization spikes may indicate inefficient algorithms or increased load.

### Database Connectivity Issues

Connection pool exhaustion is a frequent cause of database-related errors. The connection pool metrics dashboard shows current usage patterns and peak utilization.

```sql
-- Query to identify long-running transactions
SELECT 
  pid,
  now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration,
  query,
  state
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE (now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start) > interval '5 minutes';
```

### Authentication Failures

User login problems can stem from various causes including expired certificates, misconfigured identity providers, or token validation errors. The authentication service logs contain detailed information about failed login attempts.

Session timeout issues often manifest as unexpected logout events. The default session duration is configurable through the authentication service parameters. Users experiencing frequent logouts may need longer session timeouts or refresh token renewal.

### API Response Errors

HTTP 500 errors indicate server-side processing failures. These errors trigger automatic alerting to the operations team. Error details are logged with correlation IDs for tracking across service boundaries.

```python
import logging
import traceback

def handle_api_error(error, request_id):
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    
    error_details = {
        'request_id': request_id,
        'error_type': type(error).__name__,
        'error_message': str(error),
        'stack_trace': traceback.format_exc()
    }
    
    logger.error('API error occurred', extra=error_details)
    
    # Send to monitoring system
    monitoring.report_error(error_details)
```

### Rate Limiting Behaviors

When clients receive HTTP 429 responses, they have exceeded the configured rate limits. Rate limiting thresholds are configurable per API key or client IP address.

The rate limiting service uses a sliding window algorithm to track request frequencies. Clients should implement exponential backoff when encountering rate limit responses to avoid continued throttling.
