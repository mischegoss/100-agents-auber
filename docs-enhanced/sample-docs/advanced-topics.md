# Advanced Concepts

## Further Details on the System

The internal architecture relies on a message queue for decoupling services. When a task is submitted via the API, it is placed onto a RabbitMQ queue. A separate pool of worker processes consumes messages from this queue. This design choice provides resilience and scalability, as workers can be scaled independently of the web-facing API servers. The state of each job is persisted in the Redis cache to allow for quick status lookups without querying the primary database.

## System Internals

The core processing logic is implemented as a state machine. Each data processing job transitions through states like `PENDING`, `RUNNING`, `COMPLETED`, or `FAILED`. State transitions are atomic operations and are logged for auditing purposes. The framework uses a pessimistic locking strategy on the job record during state transitions to prevent race conditions between multiple workers that might attempt to process the same job.

## Memory Management

JVM garbage collection is a key performance consideration. For high-throughput installations, using the G1GC garbage collector is recommended over the default Parallel GC. You can enable this with the `-XX:+UseG1GC` JVM flag. Further tuning of region sizes and pause time goals may be necessary. Memory usage for the cache is also important; ensure the Redis `maxmemory-policy` is set to an eviction policy like `allkeys-lru` to prevent the cache from growing indefinitely and consuming all available system memory.

## Other Information

Network configuration requires careful planning in containerized environments. Port mapping conflicts are common. Use a dedicated overlay network for inter-service communication. Health checks should be configured to target a specific, lightweight endpoint rather than the main application root to ensure the load balancer can quickly and efficiently detect a failing instance without imposing unnecessary load.
