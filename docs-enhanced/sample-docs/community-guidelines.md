# Community Guidelines

## Forum Rules

This is our community, and we have high standards. All posts must be professional and directly related to our software. Do not post "me too" or "+1" comments; they are noise and will be deleted. Before asking a question, you are required to have searched all existing documentation and forum posts. If the answer already exists, your question will be locked. We expect users to contribute solutions, not just ask for help. Off-topic discussions of any kind are strictly forbidden. Failure to adhere to these rules will result in an immediate and permanent ban without warning. We do not have time to moderate frivolous conversations.
