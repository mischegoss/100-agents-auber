This is our community, and we have high standards. All posts must be professional and directly related to our software. Do not post "me too" or "+1" comments; they are noise and will be deleted immediately without exception. Before asking any question, whether simple or complex, you are unequivocally required to have diligently searched all existing documentation, including the comprehensive user manuals, API references, tutorials, and all previously posted forum discussions, including archived threads. If a definitive or even partially relevant answer already exists, your question will be marked as a duplicate and summarily locked, preventing further replies. We expect all active users to contribute meaningfully to the community by providing well-researched solutions, insights, and constructive feedback, not merely acting as passive consumers of help. Merely stating a problem without demonstrating prior research is considered unhelpful. Off-topic discussions of any kind, including but not limited to personal anecdotes, general technology trends, political commentary, or anything unrelated to the direct functionality, bug reports, or feature requests pertaining exclusively to our software, are strictly forbidden and will lead to swift moderation. Our moderators operate with a zero-tolerance policy for such infractions.

Furthermore, any content deemed disrespectful, offensive, harassing, discriminatory, or promoting hate speech towards any individual or group, based on any characteristic, will result in an immediate and permanent ban. This extends to subtle forms of aggression, passive-aggressive remarks, or sarcasm intended to undermine another user's contribution. We expect courteous and professional language at all times. Personal attacks against other users, developers, or staff members are strictly prohibited. Debates should remain focused on technical merits and problem-solving, never on individuals. Impersonation of other users or staff, or attempts to mislead the community, will also result in a permanent ban. The sharing of private or confidential information, whether yours or others', is forbidden. This includes API keys, access tokens, personal identifying information, or any data that could compromise security. Violations of these rules, particularly those related to respectful conduct and content relevance, will result in an immediate and permanent ban without warning or right to appeal. Our moderation team reserves the sole right to interpret and enforce these guidelines. Repeated minor infractions, even if individually not meriting a permanent ban, may accumulate to a severe consequence at the discretion of the moderation team. Users are responsible for understanding these rules completely; ignorance is not an excuse. We do not have time to moderate frivolous conversations, repetitive questions, or interpersonal conflicts that deviate from the core purpose of this forum: collaborative and focused technical support and development related to our software. Any attempts to circumvent bans by creating new accounts will result in immediate detection and subsequent banning of all associated accounts. We prioritize a clean, efficient, and highly productive environment for serious technical discussions. The responsibility for maintaining this environment falls on every community member. Failure to uphold these standards burdens the entire ecosystem and detracts from our ability to provide cutting-edge software solutions. This is not a social network; it is a professional support channel. Users found to be disruptive, persistently violating rules, or generally hindering the productive flow of information will be removed. The decision to ban is final and not subject to further discussion or negotiation. We value clarity and directness in communication. Ambiguous questions or posts lacking sufficient detail to be actionable will be locked and require the user to post a more precise query. Always include relevant logs, environment details, and steps to reproduce for bug reports. Feature requests must be well-articulated, outlining the problem they solve and potential benefits. Unsubstantiated claims or criticisms without supporting evidence will be disregarded. Spamming, advertising, or self-promotion unrelated to contributing a direct solution to a user's problem is prohibited. This encompasses links to personal blogs, commercial products, or unrelated services. Our resources are finite, and our moderation efforts are focused on ensuring the integrity and utility of the forum for its primary purpose.
