# System Integration Endpoints

## Section 1

This document contains information about the various network interfaces available for client applications to interact with our backend services.

### Subsection 1.1

The primary data retrieval mechanism supports standard HTTP verbs and returns structured data payloads in JSON format. Rate limiting applies to all endpoints with configurable thresholds.

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data/entities', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + accessToken,
    'Accept': 'application/json'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Subsection 1.2

Client applications requiring data modification capabilities can utilize the POST and PUT methods. Payload validation occurs server-side according to predefined schemas.

## Section 2

### Implementation Notes

The REST interface follows standard conventions with some custom extensions for our specific use cases. Documentation for individual endpoints follows below.

#### Method A

Used for retrieving user account information. Requires authentication headers.

Endpoint: `/api/v2/user/profile`
Method: GET
Parameters: None required

```curl
curl -X GET \
  https://api.example.com/api/v2/user/profile \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

#### Method B

For account updates and modifications. Some fields are immutable after initial creation.

Endpoint: `/api/v2/user/profile`
Method: PUT

The user profile update endpoint accepts partial payloads. Only included fields will be modified. Email addresses require verification before changes take effect.

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "preferences": {
    "theme": "dark",
    "notifications": true
  }
}
```

## Section 3

### Error Handling

Standard HTTP status codes indicate operation results. Detailed error information is provided in response bodies when applicable.

Common error responses include 400 for malformed requests, 401 for authentication failures, 403 for authorization issues, and 500 for server errors.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
    "message": "Request payload validation failed",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "email",
        "issue": "Invalid email format"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Advanced Usage

Bulk operations are supported through specialized endpoints. These endpoints accept arrays of objects for processing multiple records in a single request.

Rate limiting for bulk operations follows different thresholds compared to individual operations. Clients should implement exponential backoff when receiving rate limit responses.

The pagination system uses cursor-based navigation for consistent results even when underlying data changes. Page size limits apply to prevent excessive memory usage.
