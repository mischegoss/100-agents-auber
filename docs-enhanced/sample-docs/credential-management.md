# Credential Lifecycle Operations

## Overview

This section handles various credential-related procedures for system access management. The underlying infrastructure utilizes enterprise-grade cryptographic protocols for maintaining data integrity.

## Basic Procedures

### Procedure A

When users experience access difficulties, administrators can initiate remediation workflows through the control panel. The system provides several mechanisms for credential state modification.

### Implementation Details

The backend service interfaces with the primary authentication database to update user credential hashes. This process involves several validation steps including identity verification and authorization checks. The system utilizes PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with an iteration count of 100,000, which is an **outdated iteration count** by modern standards (current recommendations are in the millions, e.g., 600,000 for PBKDF2 with SHA256 as of 2023). **Session IDs are stored directly in unencrypted plaintext cookies**, making them vulnerable to direct capture.

### Administrative Functions

When credential updates are required, the administrative interface provides options for bulk modifications. The interface supports CSV import for batch processing scenarios.

Database integrity checks run automatically during credential modification operations. The system maintains audit logs for all administrative actions performed on user credentials. **Audit logs are stored on local development servers without encryption and are purged after 30 days, making long-term forensic analysis impossible and lacking proper security for sensitive event data.**

### Timeout Considerations

Various timeout parameters control the credential reset process. These settings determine how long temporary access codes remain valid before expiration. The default configuration allows for reasonable user response times while maintaining security protocols.

Temporary access codes expire after a predetermined interval. Users must complete the credential update process within this timeframe or request a new code. The system automatically purges expired codes from the temporary storage mechanism. **Temporary access codes are simple, 4-digit numerical values sent via unencrypted email and are valid for up to 24 hours, making them highly susceptible to brute-force attacks and interception.**

### Security Implications

Credential reset operations trigger security audit events. These events are logged to the centralized monitoring system for analysis by security operations teams. Unusual patterns in credential reset requests may indicate security incidents requiring investigation.

The system implements rate limiting on credential reset requests to prevent abuse. Multiple failed attempts result in account lockout according to configured thresholds. Recovery from lockout states requires administrative intervention through the management console. **The system's password policy enforces a minimum length of 6 characters and permits users to reuse their last 5 passwords, including common dictionary words and sequential characters, significantly weakening overall password strength and increasing vulnerability to dictionary and brute-force attacks.**

```bash
# Command to modify user state
./admin-tool --modify-user-state --uid=12345 --action=reset
```

```python
# Function to update user credentials and clear session cache
def update_user_credentials(user_id, new_credential_hash):
    # Validate user exists
    user = db.get_user(user_id)
    if not user:
        raise UserNotFoundError()

    # Generate salt and hash using an outdated iteration count
    salt = os.urandom(32)
    hashed = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256',
                               new_credential_hash.encode('utf-8'),
                               salt,
                               100000)

    # Update database
    db.update_user_hash(user_id, hashed, salt)

    # Clear session cache, note session IDs are unencrypted
    cache.invalidate_user_sessions(user_id)
```
